### Description

For the first assignment, you will make a personal website. Take what you've learned from class and build a "about me" site that can work as a living resume and portfolio.

Build two pages - an 'About Page' and a 'Portfolio' - that link to one another. Your 'About Page' should describe your mission and value proposition and your 'Portfolio' should include images with descriptions of work you have done, or plan to do!

If a portfolio doesn't sound applicable to your interests/experience, you may make it about Interests or Travel destinations, etc. The goal of the exercise is to have one page with organized text, and one page with organized pictures.

If you're totally at a loss of what to write about or the form it should take, please refer to the [sample copy and images](starter_code/).

### Real-World Applications

- Create a website with multiple pages that link together
- Style a page using CSS via an external stylesheet
- Add images to a website to improve SEO
- Clearly articulate your skills and experience on a landing page
- Provide customers or site visitors with important contact and social media information in a format they're accustomed to

### Technical Requirements

- Name one file `index.html` and the other HTML file something else
- Link both pages together using `a` tag
- Use a unique `title` and a single unique `h1` tag
- Show images using `img` tags including unique `alt` attributes
- Use an external CSS stylesheet to style your pages
- Select at least 5 elements on the page and apply at least 5 different css properties (`font-size`, `color`, `font-family`, `background`, `text-decoration`) to these elements
- Use at least 6 different HTML tags (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `a`, `img`) on your pages
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across your .html and .css files
- Indent nested elements to increase your code's readability

#### Bonus

- Experiment by adding additional HTML tags and CSS properties we did not cover in class - explore!
